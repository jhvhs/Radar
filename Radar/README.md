#  TO DO
- Set up multiple URL/team combinations to monitor:
    - have a separate menu extra item per URL/team pair
    - each menu extra will have a common preferences and quit action
- "Growl" Notification when transitioning to/from a failure
- Acknowledge a failing pipeline (mute a known failure)
